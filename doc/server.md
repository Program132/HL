# Server

To make a server, you need the .jar from Hytale, you can download it from [Support Hytale](https://support.hytale.com/hc/en-us/articles/45326769420827-Hytale-Server-Manual#tips-tricks) (you can get it on local once you installed the game).

How to run the server:
```bash
java -jar HytaleServer.jar --assets Assets.zip
```

Make sure to start the authentification once the server is ready:
```
/auth login device
```

By the way you can save your credentials.
